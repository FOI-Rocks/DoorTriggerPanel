# DoorTriggerPanel
This app is used as a client application for a door open sensor at the Faculty of organization and informatics. It provides an endpoint that can be triggered by the sensor which in turn interacts with the display panel. The interaction is usually in the way for playing a season specific sound and/or triggering an animation.
